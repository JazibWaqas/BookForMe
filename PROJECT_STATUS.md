## 🔑 Critical Technical Constraints

### 1. Optimistic Concurrency Control
**MUST USE**: Firestore Transactions for all booking writes  
**Why**: Prevents App User and WhatsApp User from booking same slot simultaneously  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested

### 2. Shared Database
**MUST**: Both apps read from same `/slots` collection  
**Why**: Ensures consistency between User App and WhatsApp Agent  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 3. Bilingual NLU
**MUST**: Handle Roman Urdu and English code-switching  
**Why**: Target market uses mixed language in WhatsApp messages  
**Status**: ⏳ Partial (needs improvement)

### 4. State Management
**MUST USE**: LangGraph StateGraph for conversation state  
**Why**: Multi-turn booking flows require persistent state  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
